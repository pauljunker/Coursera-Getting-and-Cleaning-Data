#Paul Junker’s Course Project for coursera course: Getting and Cleaning Data, 8/4/14 – 8/31/14

Attached is the script: run_analysis.R

To run, it should be put in your working directory. Also in your working directory should be the folder: UCI HAR Dataset.

For example:
	C:\R\MyWorkingDirectory\run_analysis.R
	C:\R\MyWorkingDirectory\ UCI HAR Dataset\<subfolders>

The run_analysis.R program has a fairly large amount of inline documentation in it to help graders understand the steps. Here at a high level are the steps.

The raw data is loaded into the following data frames: 
*df_x_test
*df_y_test 
*df_subject_test 
*df_x_train 
*df_y_train 
*df_subject_train 
*activity_labels 
*variable_names
